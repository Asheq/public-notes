Comments
================================================================================

These are my personal rules of thumb for writing comments in code.

Capitalization and punctuation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```bash
# Write comments in sentence case, where possible

echo 'hi' # This is a comment to the right of code

# This is a comment. There are periods here only because there are multiple
# sentences.

# someVar is a variable. Identifier case is not changed.
